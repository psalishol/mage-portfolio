Hey there! This is the repo for my portfolio website, and I'd love for you to check it out. Feel free to use it as inspiration for your own website.

The website showcases my skills, experience, and projects. I designed it to be creative, clean, modern, and user-friendly, with easy navigation and clear calls-to-action.

The website is built using React Native web, and is fully responsive to different screen sizes. Some of the framework used is jotai for the state management, reanimated for animation, sanity for the backend and some pngs to enhance the functionality and aesthetics of the website.

Feel free to explore the website and let me know what you think. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out. And of course, feel free to use my code as a reference for your own portfolio website!
